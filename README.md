- Admin console details are stored in `admin-console/.env`
- Avg reservation analytics uses the createdAt attribute autogenerated by the database, so if it's rebuilt all seeded data will be on the same day, you will need to manually change the date in the database to see the analytics change and behaved as expected.
- TODOs are left in the code so we can continue to work on this project in the future.
